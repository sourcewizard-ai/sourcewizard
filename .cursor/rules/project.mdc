## Project rules

This is a Next.js project, deployed to Vercel. It uses Typescript, Tailwind.
Supabase schema is located at supabase/schemas directory. This is a declarative schema, so to update it you don't need migrations, just edit the schema.
Supabase project is sfcheddgbldthfcxoaqn (typeconf).
When you've asked to create a new feature you must put the
design decisions in architecture directory.
Before implementation scan the project - find things that you can reuse, understand the component and service structure.
Separate frontend and backend properly - create or use APIs when necessary.
Separate state update on frontend from mutations on backend.
You must make concise changes and avoid updating unrelated files or implementing unrelated features if user didn't ask that explicitly.
Do NOT run or kill the development server with npm run dev, assume it's already running.
Use npx tsc --noEmit for project wide type checking.

You must always confirm that you're following rules by printing mode:typeconf at the start and at the end of your reply.
